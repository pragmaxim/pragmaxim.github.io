Chemistry that keeps us running is a valuable resource and recommended to be nurtured daily.
Neglecting it in the long term may often lead to a strategic failure while succeeding on operative basis only.
There are many aspects of self-care and ways of doing it, but one should always start with the mood in order
to do as much as possible with love, passion and joy.

Failing to do so eventually causes addiction to anything that lack of love is compensated with.
In other words, anyone who does not enjoy living becomes an addict sooner or later.
There is a variety of addictions from internet, sport, coffee, food, alcohol, sex, unhealthy relationship attachments, all the way up to pharmaceutical drugs.
In the long term, anything that is done in morbid amounts or being out of balance is wrong, even social interactions or an intense relationship.

Yes, even love must be nourished, ideally the first thing in the morning.
Waking up welcoming new day, going out with a bottle of water for a walk, stretching the body on the way and returning in good spirits while looking forward to
the daily tasks ahead of us or figuring out how to make them more pleasant so we can look forward to them next time.

Now, we need to make a habit of it, a routine. Let the body and soul get used to something that works until we have a whole bunch of useful habits we can choose from,
slowly squeezing out the bad ones. Sure, nothing is ever easy, nothing happens quickly, but it might eventually grow from a little seed to a beautiful flower :)

It is easier said than done, there are physical limits, fatigue and pain. Let's practice new habits step by step, brick by brick and day by day
so that we are driven by little victories :
 - morning walk with stretching
 - after-lunch nap to recover (can be done anywhere even on a yoga mat if you are willing to communicate your needs diplomatically with others)
 - good quantity, quality and timing of meals
 - retaining connection with nature
 - helping others
 - dropping bad influences, hateful, ungrateful or cunning people :)
