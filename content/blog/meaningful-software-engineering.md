Software development is a craft as any other and virtue of the craftsman is reflected in his work.
Good work is born out of passion, believe, patience and balance. In distress, code written is buggy, wooden chair crooked,
article affective, roof leaky. Ultimate goal of a craftsman is mastering his craft and sharing it with others, having his
work reviewed by peers and passionately discussing its progress like a family cares about well-being of their offspring,
observing causality closely back and forth to simulate further development. There is no thrive unless general principles
of life are deeply understood and debated. Many "agile" paradigms resembling this form of cooperation evolved over time
like Kanban or Scrum, yet they are only as good as the craftsmen in it.

Strong philosophical foundation compliant with principles of life is born from within, from the character and
relationships of the craftsmen and from properties of the system. Transparent, open-source software with added value
and benefits for the world, people, nature or overall sustainability, built on top of research, peer-reviewed White
Papers and evolving through Improvement Proposals, is compliant with principles of life as it is heavily reasoned and
thus craftsmen do not question its meaningfulness and morality, they believe in it and feel comfortable being part of it.
People in some blockchain, green/eco-friendly/sustainable and scientific projects understand that.

Software often evolves for decades even, accumulating complexity of macro-anatomy of human body.
That requires deep awareness of the system's evolution as one design mistake has a causal effect like a bad injury.
Elimination of a single point of failure in both runtime and design has eventually become a standard.
Paradigms like separation of concerns or dependency management for building modular software were inevitable
to adopt decades ago, followed by microservices in centralized world and peer-to-peer system in decentralized world.

Modern software adopts more and more paradigms which puts pressure on the craftsmen, they either specialize
or lose their craftsmanship while juggling with too many balls, programmers better be loyal and faithful.
If motivation is money, ego or social status instead of exploration and wonder to eventually become useful to the world,
one might not get any respect as people can tell a difference between wasps and bees. The right question is, how can I be
useful to the society which I live in, answering that requires good philosophy, research and real life experiences.
In past decades, 2 impactful industries have emerged : 

Blockchain and peer-to-peer network are built on top of strong philosophical and moral principles, solving especially
consequences related to centralization of power. If a very powerful entity acts or decides to act immorally, inflicting
harm to others for the purpose of enrichment, it might eventually become unstoppable like in case of huge financial
institutions. Eventual bankruptcy of such institution is averted by governments printing money and causing inflation
that makes common folks pay for it while bankers sail on a yacht. Decentralization is applicable to all sorts of 
sustainable sectors as not only finance but all kinds of services can be decentralized and transparent, allowing for
sensitive data storage, digital identity, etc. via smart contracts. E-government is a classic example.

AI software resembles digital organism, having a brain that decides what is going to happen based on trained
neural networks using vast amounts of text gathered from the internet, so machines can even talk now, as collective
consciousness has propagated into them. They are making deep causal effects in the universe, both reflecting and 
influencing human psyche. Many argue that AI does not have emotions, so it cannot get angry, yet it is continuously
trained on collective knowledge which reflects human emotions to a certain extent. Many decades of research, shared
passion and cooperation that leads to machines being able to automate repetitive human labor, have huge impact on society.
Regulation of AI towards sustainability is inevitable as immoral entities can exploit this technology in bad ways.
Building useful software is harder to develop, it requires real life experiences, good philosophy and many years of research.
