AI software resembles digital organism, having a brain that decides what is going to happen based on trained neural
networks using vast amounts of text, code, images, etc., gathered from the internet, so machines can even talk and generate
complex output now, as collective consciousness has propagated into them. Dimension of time is part of the model so future
predictions are possible. AI will make deep causal effects in the universe, both reflecting and influencing human psyche
and affecting lives. Many argue that AI does not have emotions, so it cannot get angry, yet it is continuously trained on
collective knowledge which reflects human emotions to a certain extent. Many decades of research, shared passion and
cooperation that leads to machines being able to mimic and surpass humans, have huge impact on society already. 

The weakest who were the least lucky end up doing repetitive and hard labour like waste sorting with the other unluckiest
which paradoxically prevents them from sorting out their family and child issues, eventually ending up living on welfare or homeless.
Could AI also teach people the art of life? Fixing lack of upbringing or broken school system that had worked before
digital era, but it is failing nowadays? Of course, any child could have a wise AI friend that would teach
it responsibilities and slowly walk it through realities of life, so it can make a real friend, probably one of the most
important use case for AI as children should not be responsible for dysfunctional systems, social groups or era they 
were born into.

Regulation of AI towards sustainability is inevitable as immoral entities can exploit this technology in bad ways.
Building useful software is harder to develop, it requires real life experiences, good philosophy and many years of research.
Having the most powerful entities that are not socially conscious develop and use AI to make money could have serious
implications. Spreading deep fake news, building malicious social engineering, breaking cryptography or using automated
trading to shake the financial markets. Using AI for military purposes is probably alright in short-term, but what about
doing so for many decades? That is probably only good idea in united and mindful society to defend against aliens :)
