Blockchain and peer-to-peer network are built on top of strong philosophical and moral principles, solving especially
problems related to centralization of power. If a very powerful entity acts or decides to act immorally, inflicting
harm to others for the purpose of enrichment, it might eventually become unstoppable like in case of huge financial
institutions. As it happens, powerful entities emerge through making money at someone's expense, exploiting greed,
weakness or fear. Selling something harmful to people is a classic example, any kind of game play with human lives at
stake is questionable. Eventual bankruptcy of such institution is averted by governments printing money and causing
inflation that makes common folks pay for it while property of responsible bankers sailing on a yacht gets valorized
even more. 

The original reason behind decentralization is fair incentivization and transparency, morality and sustainability is part
of the design so that corrupted and immoral entities cannot play the system and people. Decentralization gets us a bit
closer to the utopian idea of a society living in synergy, peace and love. It is applicable to all sorts of sustainable
sectors as many services can be implemented as decentralized application on blockchain using smart contracts, allowing
systems to leverage sensitive data storage, digital identity, etc. E-government is a classic example, at the
utopian level, democracy would be eventually fully replaced with so-called DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization.

DAO is governed from within in contrast to democracy where you delegate your vote and will to a representative. 
All the legislation would be replaced by transparent smart contracts corresponding to legislative changes and government
events and persisted indefinitely to a blockchain. Voting about legislation changes would be done by any citizen who is
interested through a decentralized application. Utopian vision that will be possible at times when AI automates repetitive
labor and people will have more time to wonder about life, times of no government corruption in games of thrones. Utopia
is not really imaginary, it is just an era of society when being good and mindful wins over evil and ignorance, times of
great prosperity. No one ever knows where the balance really is :)
