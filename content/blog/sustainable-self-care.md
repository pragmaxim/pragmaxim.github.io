Nature versus Nurture. Mankind has evolved for survival in ages of Uroboros, yet we were born into comfort, empire of Paradox.
In all times though, love shall be nourished, pain endured, puzzles solved, demons faced or befriended.
Simple realization that all we do should comply with evolution of life and be analogical to planting seeds,
watering, weeding, harvesting, grinding and baking bread is a relief, order in chaos. Nature has both questions
and answers for relationships, profession, leisure and understanding of life in general.

Whatever reasons have nurtured many into world of paradox, a labyrinth to solve, ignoring it is bliss at first but chaos
comes later when a pile of dirty laundry grows and washing it becomes inevitable. At that point, remorse expressed to the right 
people is the true conductor of the orchestra playing a symphony, peacefully and humbly, composed by evolution towards love,
a symphony called life. Times of great sacrifices, greed and lust are offerings rarely refused, going all the way is just a choice.

Pushing the wheel when it stands with single pair of hands is certainly the hardest but the more inspiration,
role models and sustainable habits the fewer bad ones and the less toxic routine that poison our lives. Physical limits, 
fatigue, pain, responsibilities, disabilities, health or Ego shall not stop us from getting our hands dirty, take risks
and make sacrifices for the greater good. Knowing value and dynamics of our emotions and feelings eliminates fear or anger
while enjoying and sharing the good parts with people around. Know thyself, care for others and you shall know the universe.

Chemistry that keeps us running is a product of our long-term struggle for ideals that reflects our ability to perceive
the world with love, passion and joy as there is always a glimmer of hope of collective synergy based on mutual respect
over rather competitive games of power and social status, fueled by unhealthy Ego, many people adopted out of fear
and insecurity, world where friends become allies in a war of conscience, the cheerleader pyramid of mutual acknowledgement.

A wheel called healthy relationship based on mutual respect needs 2 pairs of hands to keep rolling, especially in a labyrinth
while fighting minotaurs from past. Showing no compassion, honesty, remorse, encouragement, rarely helping is a one-way ticket
to cheerleader pyramid which eventually causes addiction to anything that lack of love is compensated with. One can bounce off
this bottom back to surface by deeply understanding causality / evolution of life and nature (karma), crafting philosophy
that complies with the formula of life and nurturing approximation of reality that allows for perceiving life in its true beauty.

Any trauma, complex or health issue is a labyrinth to be solved otherwise fear, addiction and eventually anger become
the Minotaur worsening the blunder. Writing a desired narrative is a privilege of those who face him fearlessly while
looking for means and ways out until it becomes a virtue that extends the depths of merit. Loosing this personal struggle
breeds either violence or cowardice, black or white reality, not balance. Any new belief or assumption that either contradicts
reality or is not constructive without any value for anyone gives birth to another Minotaur to be confronted. 

Predators inspired by wild animals or kings, addicted to taste of blood in a fearful world of games, power, competition
and schemes, haunted by memories of their pray. Hypocrites believing in close to nothing, left to compare their value
and worth to others, competing over helping, hiding behind paramoralism, empowered by schadenfreude of those they compare to,
haunted by their own shadow. Naive idealists living a fairy tale through lens of an innocent, having their dreams torn apart
by the system and predators while hypocrites giggling.

Realistic idealists, constructive problem solvers, pragmatists, optimists, better treat those who lost ideals and love
frankly or stay away as it is not a burden to bear. We are probably the only species that were given the ability to day-dream
and fulfil our dreams, yet not many who were lucky admire causality enough to even start writing narrative worth living
let alone work hard for it. Lack of dreaming or inability to take action without hesitation is just an acceptance of fate
that we were born into, a self-fulfilling prophecy crafted by nature of the era and social bubble we live in, not by us.

I sincerely hope this will encourage you to dream and work hard for it.

P.S. This writing targets mostly people in their twenties. Neither predators nor hypocrites are people I know, these are just archetypes on compass of my morality.
